- 2021-2022 (1 year long) UnB PIBIC, 
- Time Series Analysis;
- ARIMA with explanatory variables, Dynamic Harmonic Regression and TBATS models;
- EST/UNB advisor: Prof. Dr. Jos√© Augusto Fiorucci.


# Overview:

This following project assigns a complete solution for 2020 MOFC M5 Forecasting competition in kaggle. We provided forecasts about the number of daily sales of retail products, sold by Walmart in the U.S., using explanatory variables as price, payment method and commemorative dates that are provided by Walmart for the competition. More than presenting these forecasts, a solution is proposed as a submission file within the M5 Forecasting competition in order to compare the quality of the best results presented here, with the results of the other M5 participants and competitors around the world.
